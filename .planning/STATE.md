## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Moody atmospheric over cute/bubbly to stand out from Tidal branding
- Navy/slate + amber/orange palette for deeper mood and cozy vs cold tension
- React Flow for canvas (best-in-class node graph library)
- Desktop-only for hackathon judges (mobile is wasted effort)
- Tailwind CSS for styling (utility-first, rapid prototyping)
- Fredoka + Nunito typography (playful headings, readable body)
- CSS custom properties for z-index layers (centralized layer management)
